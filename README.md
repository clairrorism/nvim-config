# Neovim Config
This repo contains my personal neovim config, as you might expect. It's definitely on the leaner side as I don't really make heavy use of dark wizard features like "debuggers" as debugging React code the traditional way is actually impossible following the introduction of higher order components; five different higher order debuggers are currently in progress for this purpose and will soon be declared obsolete despite working fine for 99% of use cases when another 30 are made to patch hoc-unfucker being too slow and bloated for debugging a 500GiB bundle size web app with negative monthly users.

## Quickstart
Put init.lua into `$HOME/.config/nvim` and run neovim. You might need to install a couple things with an external package manager, it works on my machine right now so that's your job to figure out instead of my job to write a 50 character long command that works with any aur helper (no one uses distros that aren't arch, stop posing) in existence. Remember that \[REDACTED\]-analyzer is available by running \[DATA EXPUNGED\]up component add \[THIS CONTENT HAS BEEN REMOVED UNDER COPYRIGHT LAW\]-analyzer. Now you too can write another JS framework/metaframework/package manager/another new hip systems programming language because that's what we really need in the world!
